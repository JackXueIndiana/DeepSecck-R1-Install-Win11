# DeepSeek-R1-Install-Win11
Running LLM locally is very appealling as it could address many concerns regarding security and IP protection. This is the note I took when I try to install DeepSeek R1 on my laptop.

I follow this [blog](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-deepseek-locally-on-windows#:~:text=We%20will%20show%20you%20how%20to%20host%20the,the%20installer%20file%20to%20install%20the%20Chatbox%20AI.)

## Install Ollama
The first step is to install Ollama on your computer. You can download it from its [official website](https://ollama.com/). Run the installer file to install Ollama on your computer. After installing Ollama, visit its official website again and click on the Models tab on the top.

## Install DeepSeek R1 model with cmd
I select the smallest model, deepseek-r1:1.5b, by in a CMD window running this command:
~~~
ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b
~~~

## Try out
Upon successfully installation, you can start chat with the model. The speed of response generation is amazingly good even on a pretty elementary laptop.

The color of the sky, also known as the atmospheric color, is primarily due to the scattering and absorption of light in the Earth's atmosphere. When sunlight passes through these layers, it is both scattered and absorbed by various particles, including molecules and small water droplets, which are illuminated from all directions by the Sun. This process causes the colors of the visible spectrum that would otherwise be seen as a single color to appear as multiple hues or colors when observed directly by humans.
